# 4. Security Policy

## 4.1. From strategy to security policy

The security policy bridges the gap between the organization's overall security vision and the practical steps employees take to achieve it. It serves as a formal document outlining:

- **Acceptable Use:** Defines appropriate and inappropriate behaviors regarding IT resources, data handling, and internet usage.
- **Password Management:** Establishes guidelines for creating strong passwords, changing them regularly, and using them securely.
- **Data Security:** Defines protocols for data classification, storage, transmission, and disposal to protect sensitive information.
- **Incident Response:** Outlines procedures for identifying, reporting, and responding to security incidents like malware attacks or data breaches.
- **Security Awareness:** Describes training programs and ongoing initiatives to educate employees about cybersecurity best practices.
- **Access Control:** Defines who has access to specific IT systems and data based on the principle of least privilege.

## 4.2. Properties of a security policy

An effective security policy should be:

- **Clear and concise:** Easy to understand for all employees, regardless of technical background.
- **Comprehensive:** Address all relevant security aspects like password management, data protection, and acceptable use.
- **Accessible:** Readily available to all employees electronically or in printed format.
- **Enforceable:** Have clear consequences for violating the policy.
- **Reviewed and updated regularly:** Adapt to evolving threats and changes in technology and regulations.

## 4.3. Methods and standards contributing to the definition of a security policy

Developing a robust security policy involves leveraging established standards and best practices.

### 4.3.1. ISO 27000 series international standards

The ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provides a comprehensive framework for information security management. These standards offer guidelines for identifying security risks, implementing controls, and achieving an overall information security posture.

### 4.3.2. Methods and good practices

Beyond established standards, incorporating best practices like risk assessments, threat modeling, and user education is crucial.

- **Risk assessments:** Identify and prioritize potential security threats to guide control selection.
- **Threat modeling:** Analyze potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities within systems and data.
- **User education:** Educate employees about security risks and their role in protecting information.

### 4.3.3. Formal security policy model

Several formal security policy models can help structure your policy document. These models often include sections on security objectives, organizational roles, acceptable use, access control, incident response, and business continuity planning.

## 4.4. From politics to security measures

The security policy translates security principles into concrete measures to safeguard information assets.

### 4.4.1. Resource classification

A critical first step is classifying information assets based on their sensitivity. This helps determine the level of protection required for different types of data. Common classification levels include:

- Public: Freely available information.
- Confidential: Sensitive information requiring controlled access.
- Secret: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls.
- Top Secret: Information vital to national security with the most stringent access limitations.

### 4.4.2.Security measures

Once resources are classified, appropriate security measures can be implemented. These may include:

- **Technical Controls:** Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, data encryption, and access control mechanisms.
- **Procedural Controls:** Policies, procedures, and guidelines for handling sensitive information and IT resources.
- **Physical Controls:** Limiting physical access to data centers and other critical infrastructure.

## 4.5. Continuity of services, activities and crisis management

This section focuses on ensuring critical business functions can continue even during disruptions.

### 4.5.1. Definitions and objectives

- **Business Continuity Management (BCM):** The process of ensuring critical operations can resume quickly after a disaster or disruption.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** The technical aspects of restoring IT systems and data after a disaster.

The objective of BCM is to minimize downtime and ensure the organization can continue essential functions during incidents.

### 4.5.2. Approach to deploying a continuity plan

Developing a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) involves:

- **Identifying critical business functions:** Processes essential for ongoing operations.
- **Conducting a Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Assessing the potential impact of disruptions on critical functions.
- **Developing recovery strategies:** Creating plans to restore critical functions after an incident.
- **Testing and maintaining the BCP:** Regularly testing the plan and updating it as needed.

### 4.5.3. Continuity and recovery plans

Following the identification of critical functions and their potential disruptions, the BCP outlines detailed recovery plans. These plans should address various incident scenarios, including:

- **Natural disasters:** Floods, earthquakes, fires.
- **IT outages:** Hardware failures, cyberattacks, power outages.
- **Pandemics:** Disruptions caused by widespread illnesses.
- **Supply chain disruptions:** Inability to receive critical materials or products.

### 4.5.4. Emergency devices and emergency plan

- **Emergency Devices:** Identify and ensure the availability of critical equipment for emergency response, such as backup generators, communication tools, and first-aid kits.
- **Emergency Plan:** Develop a plan outlining procedures for responding to emergencies like fires, natural disasters, or security breaches. The plan should include:
  - Evacuation procedures
  - Communication protocols for notifying employees and stakeholders
  - Procedures for activating the Business Continuity Plan

### 4.5.5. Action plan

The final step involves creating an action plan to implement the BCP. This plan outlines:

- **Resource allocation:** Assigning personnel and resources for BCP development and execution.
- **Training and awareness:** Educating employees on their roles and responsibilities during disruptions.
- **Testing and exercising:** Regularly testing the BCP to identify and address weaknesses.
- **Maintenance and updates:** Updating the BCP to reflect changes in the organization or its environment.

## 4.6. Place of information systems audit in terms of security

### 4.6.1. Information systems audit

An information systems audit (ISA) is an independent review of an organization's IT infrastructure and controls to assess its security posture. ISAs play a crucial role in identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with regulations, and verifying the effectiveness of security controls.

- **Vulnerability Identification:** ISAs can uncover weaknesses in security controls, system configurations, and user behavior, allowing for timely remediation.
- **Compliance Verification:** ISAs can help organizations ensure they meet security requirements set forth by industry regulations or internal policies.
- **Security Control Effectiveness:** ISAs evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of implemented security controls in mitigating identified risks.

## 4.7. Measuring security effectiveness

Quantifying the effectiveness of security measures allows organizations to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and allocate resources efficiently.

### 4.7.1. Security Metrics

Security metrics are measurable indicators that track the performance of security controls and the overall security posture. Here are some examples:

- **Number of security incidents:** Tracks the frequency of security breaches, malware infections, or other security events.
- **Mean time to detection (MTD):** Measures the average time it takes to identify a security incident.
- **Mean time to recovery (MTTR):** Measures the average time it takes to resolve a security incident and restore normal operations.
- **Vulnerability patching rate:** Tracks the speed at which identified vulnerabilities are patched or addressed.
- **Security awareness training completion rate:** Measures employee participation in security awareness programs.

### 4.7.2. Maturity model

A maturity model is a framework that defines progressive levels of security capability. Organizations can assess their current security posture against the model and identify areas for improvement.

1.  **Initial:** Security is reactive and ad-hoc.
2.  **Repeatable:** Basic security processes are in place, but not consistently applied.
3.  **Defined:** Documented security policies and procedures exist.
4.  **Managed:** Security controls are monitored and measured.
5.  **Optimizing:** Security is continuously improved based on data and feedback.

## 4.8. Certification of security products

Security product certifications provide independent verification of a product's security features and capabilities. These certifications can help organizations make informed decisions when selecting security solutions.

### 4.8.1. Common Criteria

The Common Criteria (CC) is an international standard for evaluating information technology security. Products that undergo rigorous testing and meet specific security requirements can achieve CC certification. CC certification provides assurance that a product has been evaluated against a defined set of security criteria.

- **Increased confidence in security features:** Certification verifies that a product meets specific security requirements.
- **Improved interoperability:** CC-certified products are more likely to interoperate with other certified products.
- **Demonstrated compliance:** Certifications can help organizations meet regulatory requirements.

### 4.8.2.Actors concerned by the Common Criteria

- **Evaluating laboratories:** Independent labs authorized to conduct CC evaluations.
- **Certification bodies:** Organizations that issue CC certificates based on evaluations.
- **Vendors:** Manufacturers of security products seeking CC certification.
- **Users:** Organizations that rely on CC certifications when selecting security products.

### 4.8.3. Main limitations of the Common Criteria

- **Cost and Time:** CC certification can be expensive and time-consuming for vendors.
- **Evolving Threats:** Security threats are constantly evolving, and certifications may not reflect the latest vulnerabilities.
- **Focus on Functionality:** CC focuses on product functionality, not necessarily ease of use or deployment.
