<h3 id="availability">1.1.1. Availability</h3>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> means data are accessible when you need them.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> of data is crucial to daily operations of our system. Without access to our data, everything grinds to a halt, which is why medical and educational institutions are often targeted for ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>Ransomware attacks attempt to withhold <strong>availability</strong> of critical information until a ransom is paid. We use various hardware and software measures to detect and prevent such attacks, protecting the <strong>availability</strong> of our data. Our users also contribute to this effort by detecting and reporting phishing and other suspicious activity.</p>
<h3 id="integrity">1.1.2. Integrity</h3>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> means data are trustworthy, complete, and have not been accidentally altered or modified by an unauthorized user.</p>
<p>The <strong>integrity</strong> of data may be compromised unintentionally by a system malfunction, errors in entering data, or forgetting to maintain an up-to-date backup.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong> can also be compromised by malicious actors attempting to tamper with data. For example, a phishing scam aimed at changing bank account routing numbers in our payroll system is threat to the <strong>integrity</strong> of our data.</p>
<h3 id="confidentiality">1.1.3. Confidentiality</h3>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> refers to protecting information from unauthorized access. Maintaining <strong>confidentiality</strong> helps achieve multiple important goals, including ensuring privacy and avoiding ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>A familiar example we use to protect <strong>confidentiality</strong> is logging into systems using a 2FA key.</p>
<p>This login and identity authentication process protects the <strong>confidentiality</strong> of information created, stored, and transferred on our systems by restricting access to authorized users.</p>
<h3 id="identification-and-authentication">1.1.4. Identification and Authentication</h3>
<p><strong>Identification</strong> and <strong>Authentication</strong> are two crucial security principles that ensure only authorized users can access our systems and data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identification</strong> establishes who a user is claiming to be. This might involve a username, an email address, or a unique identifier.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> verifies that the user is who they claim to be. This typically involves a password, a security token, or biometrics like fingerprints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our systems employ a multi-layered approach to <strong>identification</strong> and <strong>authentication</strong>. This might involve a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usernames and passwords</li>
<li>Two-factor authentication (2FA) using security tokens or codes sent via SMS/email</li>
<li>Biometric authentication (fingerprint scanners, facial recognition)</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing strong <strong>identification</strong> and <strong>authentication</strong> measures, we significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to our systems and data.</p>
<h3 id="non-repudiation">1.1.5. Non-repudiation</h3>
<p><strong>Non-repudiation</strong> ensures that a user cannot deny performing an action in a system. This is critical for maintaining accountability and preventing fraud.</p>
<p>Our systems typically achieve <strong>non-repudiation</strong> through comprehensive logging practices. These logs record user activity, including actions taken, timestamps, and user identifiers. With proper logging, a user cannot claim they did not perform an action if a clear record exists within the system.</p>
<p><strong>Non-repudiation</strong> is particularly important for financial transactions, legal documents, and other sensitive actions where a clear audit trail is necessary.</p>

<h1>2. Cybercrime and IT security</h1>
<h2 id="understanding-the-threat-of-criminal-origin-for-better-security">2.1. Understanding the Threat of Criminal Origin for Better Security</h2>
<p>Building strong cybersecurity relies on knowing your enemy, by understanding the motivations and methods of cybercriminals.</p>
<p>First, we need to know who <strong>cybercriminals</strong> are?</p>
<p><strong>Cybercriminals</strong> are individuals or teams of people who use technology to commit malicious activities on digital systems or networks with the intention of stealing sensitive company information or personal data, and generating profit.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types of Cybercriminals:</strong> There’s a range of attackers, from organized crime groups with advanced tools to script kiddies using basic hacking scripts. Even insiders with authorized access can be a threat.</li>
<li><strong>Motivations Behind Attacks:</strong> Money is a big driver, but disruption, information gathering, ideology, and even recognition can all motivate cybercrime.</li>
<li><strong>How They Operate:</strong> Social engineering tricks people into giving up information, malware infects systems, zero-day exploits find weaknesses, DoS attacks overwhelm targets, and supply chain attacks compromise multiple systems at once.</li>
<li><strong>The Benefit of Understanding:</strong> Knowing the threat landscape helps us prioritize security spending, target defenses to specific threats, train employees to avoid scams, and stay ahead of evolving tactics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="infrastructure-internet-and-vulnerabilities-exploited-for-criminal-purposes">2.2. Infrastructure Internet and vulnerabilities exploited for criminal purposes</h2>
<h3 id="vulnerability-elements-of-an-internet-infrastructure">2.2.1. Vulnerability elements of an Internet infrastructure</h3>
<p>The internet infrastructure itself has inherent weaknesses that cybercriminals can target. some key vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unpatched Software:</strong> Outdated software with known vulnerabilities creates easy entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals actively scan for unpatched systems and exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Misconfigured Systems:</strong> Systems that are not configured securely can be vulnerable to attacks. This can include weak passwords, unnecessary services running, or insecure access controls.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy Systems:</strong> Older systems may no longer be supported by vendors, making them difficult or impossible to patch, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits.</li>
<li><strong>The Human Element:</strong> Even with the best technology, human error can play a role. Employees clicking on malicious links, falling for phishing scams, or using weak passwords can unknowingly compromise security.</li>
<li><strong>The Interconnected Nature of the Internet:</strong> The interconnectedness of the internet means that a vulnerability in one system can be exploited to gain access to other systems. This can create a domino effect, allowing attackers to compromise a larger network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="internet-as-a-performance-factor-for-the-criminal-world">2.2.2. Internet as a performance factor for the criminal world</h3>

<h2 id="attacks-computers-via-the-internet">2.4. Attacks Computers via the Internet</h2>
<h3 id="basic-principles-of-carrying-out-a-cyberattack">2.4.1. Basic Principles of Carrying out a Cyberattack</h3>
<p>Cyberattacks often follow a similar lifecycle, with some variations depending on the specific goal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> The attacker gathers information about the target, such as identifying vulnerabilities in systems, network architecture, and potential entry points. Techniques used could include scanning for open ports, social engineering to trick employees into revealing information, or exploiting publicly available data.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery:</strong> The attacker delivers the malicious payload to the target system. This could involve sending a phishing email with an infected attachment, exploiting a vulnerability in a web application, or tricking a user into downloading malware.</li>
<li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> The attacker leverages the delivered payload to exploit a vulnerability in the system. This might involve injecting malicious code, compromising user credentials, or gaining unauthorized access to the system.</li>
<li><strong>Installation:</strong> The attacker establishes a foothold on the system by installing malware or other tools that allow for remote access and control.</li>
<li><strong>Command and Control (C&amp;C):</strong> The attacker establishes communication with the compromised system, allowing them to issue commands, steal data, or launch further attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Actions on Objectives:</strong> Once established within the system, the attacker achieves their objective, which could be stealing data, disrupting operations, deploying ransomware, or installing additional malware.</li>
<li><strong>Cover Tracks:</strong> The attacker may attempt to erase their tracks and avoid detection by security measures.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="active-and-passive-attacks">2.4.2. Active and Passive Attacks</h3>
<p>Cyberattacks can be categorized based on their approach to gathering information or achieving objectives:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Active Attacks:</strong> These attacks directly attempt to alter, damage, or steal data from a system. e.g.:
<ul>
<li>Injecting malicious code (viruses, worms)</li>
<li>Launching denial-of-service attacks to overwhelm a system</li>
<li>Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access</li>
<li>Using brute-force attacks to guess passwords</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Passive Attacks:</strong> These attacks focus on intercepting data without altering the system itself. e.g.:
<ul>
<li>Sniffing network traffic to capture passwords or sensitive information</li>
<li>Social engineering to trick users into revealing information</li>
<li>Analyzing network traffic patterns to identify potential vulnerabilities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="password-theft-attacks">2.4.3. Password Theft Attacks</h3>
<p>Passwords are often the first line of defense for protecting computer systems and data. Cybercriminals employ various techniques to steal passwords, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Deceptive emails or messages attempt to trick users into revealing their passwords. These emails may appear to be from legitimate sources like banks, credit card companies, or even colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Brute-Force Attacks:</strong> Automated tools systematically try different password combinations until they guess the correct one. Strong passwords with a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are more resistant to brute-force attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary Attacks:</strong> These attacks try common words and phrases found in dictionaries or leaked password databases to guess passwords. Using complex, unique passwords helps mitigate this risk.</li>
<li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Attackers trick users into revealing their passwords through manipulation or deception. This could involve posing as a technical support representative or exploiting a user’s sense of urgency or fear.</li>
<li><strong>Keyloggers:</strong> These malicious programs record all keystrokes typed on a computer, including passwords. Anti-virus software and good security hygiene (not entering passwords on untrusted devices) can help prevent keyloggers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-organizations-facing-cybercrime-and-nuisances">2.5. The Organizations Facing Cybercrime and Nuisances</h2>
<p>Cybercrime has become a widespread threat, which target:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="dark-figure-of-cybercrime">2.5.1. Dark figure of cybercrime</h3>
<p>The true extent of cybercrime is difficult to measure due to the secret nature of these activities. Many cyberattacks go unreported, either because victims are unaware of the attack or are reluctant to report it due to fear of reputational damage or legal repercussions. This unreported crime is known as the dark figure of cybercrime. some reasons why cyberattacks go unreported:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of awareness:</strong> Some victims might not even realize they have been attacked, especially if the attack was sophisticated or targeted a specific part of the system.</li>
<li><strong>Fear of damage:</strong> Businesses may be hesitant to report an attack if they fear it will damage their reputation or lead to a loss of customer trust.</li>
<li><strong>Legal concerns:</strong> Some organizations may worry that reporting an attack could open them up to legal liability, especially if sensitive data was breached.</li>
<li><strong>Technical challenges:</strong> Investigating a cyberattack can be complex and expensive, and some organizations may not have the resources to do so effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of accurate data on cybercrime makes it difficult to assess the true impact of these attacks and develop effective prevention strategies.</p>
<h3 id="safety-culture">2.5.2. Safety culture</h3>
<p>A safety culture is an organizational environment that prioritizes security and risk mitigation. In the context of cybersecurity, a safety culture emphasizes the importance of protecting information assets and systems from cyberattacks. some characteristics of a strong safety culture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encryption algorithms come in two main categories: symmetric and asymmetric.</li>
<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption. This is like having a padlock where the same key opens and locks it.</li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses a pair of mathematically linked keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption. This is like having a mailbox with two slots: one for anyone to put things in (public key), and a special key only you have to retrieve them (private key).</li>
<li>The choice of encryption algorithm and key management strategy depends on the specific security requirements of the application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-cryptographic-systems">5.2. Main cryptographic systems</h2>
<h3 id="symmetric-encryption-system">5.2.1. Symmetric encryption system</h3>
<p>In a symmetric system, the same secret key is shared between the sender and receiver. The sender encrypts the plaintext with the key, and the receiver uses the same key to decrypt the ciphertext.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient for large amounts of data due to simpler algorithms.</li>
<li>Faster encryption and decryption compared to asymmetric systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key distribution is a challenge. Both parties need the same secret key securely exchanged, which can be difficult to manage.</li>
<li>Compromising a single key can expose all data encrypted with that key.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asymmetric-encryption-system">5.2.2. Asymmetric encryption system</h3>
<p>In an asymmetric system, a public key pair is used. The public key is widely distributed, while the private key is kept secret. Anyone can encrypt data with the public key, but only the holder of the private key can decrypt it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Public key distribution is simpler. The public key can be made readily available without compromising security.</li>
<li>Offers benefits like digital signatures and non-repudiation.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Session key:</strong> A temporary key used to encrypt data for a single session or transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Improves efficiency for large data:</strong> Symmetric encryption with a session key is faster for encrypting large data volumes compared to asymmetric encryption.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces risk of key exposure:</strong> Compromised session key only impacts the current data transfer, not past or future sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="check-data-integrity">5.3.2. Check data integrity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combined with hashing algorithms:</strong> Encryption can be used alongside hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) to verify data integrity during transmission or storage.</li>
<li><strong>Hashing generates a unique fingerprint of the data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If the data is tampered with, the hash will not match the original, indicating a security breach.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authenticate-and-sign">5.3.3.Authenticate and sign</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital signatures:</strong> Asymmetric encryption can be used to create digital signatures, which authenticate the sender of a message.</li>
<li><strong>The sender uses their private key to sign the data, and the receiver uses the sender’s public key to verify the signature.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This ensures the message originated from the claimed sender and has not been altered in transit.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="make-confidential-and-authenticate">5.3.4. Make confidential and authenticate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Combining techniques: Encryption can be combined with digital signatures to achieve both confidentiality and authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Data is encrypted with a symmetric key for confidentiality.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The symmetric key itself is then encrypted with the receiver’s public key for secure transmission.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The receiver uses their private key to decrypt the symmetric key and then decrypt the data.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Certificates are issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and contain information for validation.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-of-a-secure-transaction-via-pki">5.4.4. Example of a secure transaction via PKI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):</strong> A framework that relies on digital certificates and CAs for secure communication.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> In a secure online transaction, the website’s public key certificate is verified by the user’s browser using a trusted CA.</li>

<h1>6. Security of telecommunications infrastructures</h1>
<h2 id="ipv4-protocol">6.1. IPv4 protocol</h2>
<p>The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the foundation of communication on the internet. While it has served us well for decades, it has limitations regarding security. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited address space:</strong> IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, restricting the total number of unique addresses available. This limitation has led to the exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Weak authentication:</strong> IPv4 doesn’t inherently provide strong authentication mechanisms to verify the sender of a data packet. This makes it vulnerable to spoofing attacks where malicious actors can impersonate legitimate users.</li>
<li><strong>Limited confidentiality:</strong> IPv4 doesn’t offer built-in encryption for data packets. This means the data travels in plain text, potentially exposing sensitive information if intercepted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ipv6-and-ipsec-protocols">6.2. IPv6 and IPSec protocols</h2>
<h3 id="main-features-of-ipv6">6.2.1. Main features of IPv6</h3>
<p>IPv6 is the next-generation internet protocol designed to overcome IPv4’s shortcomings. Here are its security benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Larger address space:</strong> IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, providing a significantly larger pool of unique addresses compared to IPv4. This caters to the ever-growing number of internet devices.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced authentication:</strong> IPv6 incorporates features for sender authentication, making it more difficult for attackers to spoof their identity.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in encryption:</strong> While not mandatory, IPv6 has built-in support for encryption mechanisms, improving data confidentiality.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="main-features-of-ipsec">6.2.2. Main features of IPSec</h3>
<p>IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) is a suite of protocols that addresses security concerns at the network layer. It operates on top of IPv4 or IPv6 to provide secure communication channels. Here’s what IPSec offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data confidentiality:</strong> IPSec can encrypt data packets using strong algorithms, ensuring only authorized recipients can access the information.</li>
<li><strong>Data integrity:</strong> IPSec can verify data hasn’t been tampered with during transmission. This is crucial for protecting data accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> IPSec can authenticate the sender and receiver of data packets, preventing unauthorized access and impersonation attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authentication-header-ah">6.2.3. Authentication Header (AH)</h3>
<p>The Authentication Header (AH) is one of the core protocols within IPSec. It focuses on providing data integrity and sender authentication for data packets. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> AH adds a digital signature to the data packet. This signature is calculated using a cryptographic hash function and a shared secret key between sender and receiver. Any alteration to the data during transmission will change the signature, allowing the receiver to detect tampering.</li>
<li><strong>Sender Authentication:</strong> The digital signature also includes the sender’s identity. By verifying the signature using the shared key, the receiver can confirm the legitimacy of the sender.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, AH <strong>does not</strong> encrypt the data itself. This means the content remains readable if intercepted by a third party.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-header-authentication-esp">6.2.4. Privacy header – authentication (ESP)</h3>
<p>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol within IPSec offers both data confidentiality and authentication. It complements AH by adding another layer of security:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Confidentiality:</strong> ESP encrypts the entire data packet using a chosen encryption algorithm and a shared key. This scrambles the data, making it unreadable to anyone who doesn’t possess the decryption key.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication (optional):</strong> Similar to AH, ESP can optionally include a digital signature to authenticate the sender.</li>
</ul>
<p>ESP provides a more comprehensive security solution compared to AH, but it comes with a higher computational cost due to encryption.</p>
<h3 id="security-association">6.2.5. Security Association</h3>
<p>A Security Association (SA) is a fundamental concept in IPSec. It establishes a secure communication channel between two devices. An SA defines the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Protocols:</strong> This specifies which IPSec protocols will be used (e.g., AH or ESP, or both).</li>
<li><strong>Encryption Algorithms:</strong> This defines the algorithms used for encryption (if ESP is used)</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Algorithms:</strong> This defines the algorithms used for creating and verifying digital signatures.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Keys:</strong> Securely generated secret keys are used for encryption and decryption (for ESP) and digital signature verification (for AH or ESP).</li>
<li><strong>Lifetime:</strong> An SA has a defined lifetime after which a new one needs to be established for continued secure communication.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-ipsec">6.2.6. Implementing IPSec</h3>
<p>IPSec can be implemented on various network devices like routers, firewalls, and endpoint devices (e.g., laptops). The specific configuration steps vary depending on the device and operating system. Generally, it involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configuring IPSec policies:</strong> These policies define which traffic should be secured using IPSec and the chosen security parameters (e.g., protocols, algorithms).</li>
<li><strong>Key Management:</strong> Secure generation, distribution, and storage of shared keys used for encryption and authentication within SAs.</li>
<li><strong>Configuring Network Devices:</strong> The IPSec policies and SAs are configured on the relevant network devices to initiate secure communication.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encryption-key-management">6.2.7. Encryption key management</h3>
<p>Encryption key management is critical for IPSec’s security. Strong and properly managed keys ensure the effectiveness of encryption. Here are some key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Generation:</strong> Keys should be cryptographically strong and generated securely using a certified random number generator.</li>
