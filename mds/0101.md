## 1.1. Client Server Model

The client–server model is a **distributed** application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called **servers**, and service **requesters**, called clients.

Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server **host** runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients.

A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client–server model are **email**, network printing, and the **World Wide Web**.

## 1.2 Advantage of Client-Server architecture

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

Client-Server architecture has several  
advantages, such as:

### 1.2.1 Centralized resources

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

When all of the data is stored in a single place, it is much easier for administrators to manage and maintain a **single** server, rather than having to manage multiple servers or devices.

### 1.2.2 Better security

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

Because of the centralized nature of client/server architecture, it is easier to implement security measures such as access control and data encryption.

It is also easier to monitor the system for suspicious activity and to quickly respond to security incidents.

### 1.2.3 Server-level administration

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

All of the administration tasks are performed on the server.

This makes it easier to manage the system as a whole, and it also makes it easier to troubleshoot problems.

### 1.2.4 Scalable network

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

Client/server architecture can be expanded to accommodate more users and data. This is because the server can be upgraded to handle more requests, and new clients can be added to the network without impacting the performance of the system as a whole.

## 1.3. Disadvantages of the client/server model

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

Client-Server architecture has several  
disadvantages, such as:

### 1.3.1 High cost

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

Setting up and maintaining a client/server system can be expensive. The cost of hardware, software, and IT staff can be significant, especially for large organizations.

### 1.3.2 A weak link

:::columns

:::{.column width=50%}

If the server goes down, the entire network is affected. This can be a major problem for businesses that rely on their networks to operate.
