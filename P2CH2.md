# Cybercrime and IT security

## 2.1. Understanding the Threat of Criminal Origin for Better Security

Building strong cybersecurity relies on knowing your enemy, by understanding the motivations and methods of cybercriminals.

First, we need to know who **cybercriminals** are?

**Cybercriminals** are individuals or teams of people who use technology to commit malicious activities on digital systems or networks with the intention of stealing sensitive company information or personal data, and generating profit.

- **Types of Cybercriminals:** There's a range of attackers, from organized crime groups with advanced tools to script kiddies using basic hacking scripts. Even insiders with authorized access can be a threat.
- **Motivations Behind Attacks:** Money is a big driver, but disruption, information gathering, ideology, and even recognition can all motivate cybercrime.
- **How They Operate:** Social engineering tricks people into giving up information, malware infects systems, zero-day exploits find weaknesses, DoS attacks overwhelm targets, and supply chain attacks compromise multiple systems at once.
- **The Benefit of Understanding:** Knowing the threat landscape helps us prioritize security spending, target defenses to specific threats, train employees to avoid scams, and stay ahead of evolving tactics.

## 2.2. Infrastructure Internet and vulnerabilities exploited for criminal purposes

### 2.2.1. Vulnerability elements of an Internet infrastructure

The internet infrastructure itself has inherent weaknesses that cybercriminals can target. some key vulnerabilities:

- **Unpatched Software:** Outdated software with known vulnerabilities creates easy entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals actively scan for unpatched systems and exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
- **Misconfigured Systems:** Systems that are not configured securely can be vulnerable to attacks. This can include weak passwords, unnecessary services running, or insecure access controls.
- **Legacy Systems:** Older systems may no longer be supported by vendors, making them difficult or impossible to patch, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits.
- **The Human Element:** Even with the best technology, human error can play a role. Employees clicking on malicious links, falling for phishing scams, or using weak passwords can unknowingly compromise security.
- **The Interconnected Nature of the Internet:** The interconnectedness of the internet means that a vulnerability in one system can be exploited to gain access to other systems. This can create a domino effect, allowing attackers to compromise a larger network.

### 2.2.2. Internet as a performance factor for the criminal world

The very features that make the internet so useful also make it attractive to cybercriminals in several ways:

- **Anonymity:** The internet allows criminals to operate anonymously, making it difficult to track them down and hold them accountable.
- **Accessibility:** The widespread availability of the internet makes it easy for anyone with a connection to participate in cybercrime.
- **Global Reach:** Cybercriminals can launch attacks from anywhere in the world, targeting victims across geographical boundaries.
- **Low Barriers to Entry:** Many hacking tools and techniques are readily available online, lowering the technical skills required to launch cyberattacks.
- **Speed of Attacks:** Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities and launch attacks very quickly, making it difficult for organizations to react and defend themselves.

### 2.2.3. Internet at the heart of criminal strategies

The internet is not just a tool for cybercrime; it's often the very target itself. Here's how criminals leverage the internet for their activities:

- **Data Breaches:** Cybercriminals steal vast amounts of personal data, including credit card numbers, social security numbers, and medical records, which they can then sell on the black market or use for identity theft.
- **Malware Distribution:** Malicious software like viruses, ransomware, and spyware is often distributed through the internet, infecting computers and stealing data or disrupting operations.
- **Financial Scams:** Cybercriminals use phishing emails, fake websites, and other online scams to trick people into revealing financial information or sending money.
- **Command and Control:** Cybercriminals use the internet to remotely control compromised computers, often forming botnets to launch large-scale attacks.
- **Disinformation Campaigns:** The internet is used to spread misinformation and propaganda, which can manipulate public opinion.

### 2.2.4. Risk of criminal origin and technological insecurity

The combination of a vulnerable internet infrastructure and the ease with which it can be exploited by criminals creates a significant risk for organizations and individuals.
This risk is further amplified by the ever-evolving nature of technology. As new technologies emerge, so do new vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit.

## 2.3. Crime IT and cybercrime

### 2.3.1. Defining Cybercrime Elements

Cybercrime can be defined as any criminal activity that involves the use of computers, networks, and the internet. It encompasses a wide range of activities, but some key elements are:

- **Use of Technology:** Cybercrime relies on computers, networks, and the internet to commit the crime. This can include using a computer to steal data, launch an attack, or spread malware.
- **Illegality:** Cybercrime involves violating the law. This could be stealing data, disrupting critical infrastructure, or launching a denial-of-service attack.
- **Criminal Intent:** Cybercrime requires the deliberate act of committing a crime using technology. Accidental data breaches or unintended consequences wouldn't typically fall under this umbrella.

### 2.3.2. The Cybercriminal Ecosystem

Cybercrime isn't a solitary endeavor; it often involves a network of individuals and groups with specialized skills working together. Here's a look at the key players:

- **Hackers:** These individuals possess technical skills they use to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. Their skill levels can vary greatly.
- **Malware Developers:** These individuals create malicious software like viruses, ransomware, and spyware used to steal data, disrupt operations, or extort money.
- **Social Engineers:** These individuals use psychological manipulation to trick people into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.
- **Booter Operators:** These individuals provide services that launch denial-of-service attacks, overwhelming websites or servers with traffic and making them inaccessible.
- **Money Launderers:** These individuals help cybercriminals convert illegally obtained funds into legitimate-looking assets.
- **Organizers and Financiers:** These individuals orchestrate cybercrime operations, providing funding and resources to other participants.

### 2.3.3. Cybercrime Black Markets

The dark web harbors hidden marketplaces where cybercriminals can buy and sell a variety of illicit goods and services. Here's what you might find:

- **Stolen Data:** Credit card information, social security numbers, and other personal data can be purchased in bulk on these markets.
- **Malware:** A variety of malicious software, including viruses, ransomware, and exploit kits, can be purchased or rented on these markets.
- **Hacking Tools:** Tools that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks are available for purchase.
- **Hacking-as-a-Service (HaaS):** This service allows individuals with limited technical skills to hire hackers to launch attacks on their behalf.
- **Anonymous Services:** These services help cybercriminals mask their identities and evade detection by law enforcement.

### 2.3.4.Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism and Cyberwar

While all three involve technology, there are key distinctions:

- **Cybercrime:** Primarily motivated by financial gain or other personal benefits. Targets can be individuals, businesses, or organizations, and the goal is typically to steal data, disrupt operations, or extort money.
- **Cyberterrorism:** Uses computer attacks to instill fear or terror in a population or to coerce a government or organization to take a certain action. The goal is often political or ideological.
- **Cyberwar:** Cyber attacks launched by one nation-state against another, used to disrupt critical infrastructure, cripple military operations, or steal sensitive information. Cyberwar is a potential escalation of traditional warfare.

## 2.4. Attacks Computers via the Internet

### 2.4.1. Basic Principles of Carrying out a Cyberattack

Cyberattacks often follow a similar lifecycle, with some variations depending on the specific goal.

- **Reconnaissance:** The attacker gathers information about the target, such as identifying vulnerabilities in systems, network architecture, and potential entry points. Techniques used could include scanning for open ports, social engineering to trick employees into revealing information, or exploiting publicly available data.
- **Delivery:** The attacker delivers the malicious payload to the target system. This could involve sending a phishing email with an infected attachment, exploiting a vulnerability in a web application, or tricking a user into downloading malware.
- **Exploitation:** The attacker leverages the delivered payload to exploit a vulnerability in the system. This might involve injecting malicious code, compromising user credentials, or gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Installation:** The attacker establishes a foothold on the system by installing malware or other tools that allow for remote access and control.
- **Command and Control (C&C):** The attacker establishes communication with the compromised system, allowing them to issue commands, steal data, or launch further attacks.
- **Actions on Objectives:** Once established within the system, the attacker achieves their objective, which could be stealing data, disrupting operations, deploying ransomware, or installing additional malware.
- **Cover Tracks:** The attacker may attempt to erase their tracks and avoid detection by security measures.

### 2.4.2. Active and Passive Attacks

Cyberattacks can be categorized based on their approach to gathering information or achieving objectives:

1. **Active Attacks:** These attacks directly attempt to alter, damage, or steal data from a system. e.g.:
   - Injecting malicious code (viruses, worms)
   - Launching denial-of-service attacks to overwhelm a system
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access
   - Using brute-force attacks to guess passwords
2. **Passive Attacks:** These attacks focus on intercepting data without altering the system itself. e.g.:
   - Sniffing network traffic to capture passwords or sensitive information
   - Social engineering to trick users into revealing information
   - Analyzing network traffic patterns to identify potential vulnerabilities

### 2.4.3. Password Theft Attacks

Passwords are often the first line of defense for protecting computer systems and data. Cybercriminals employ various techniques to steal passwords, including:

- **Phishing Attacks:** Deceptive emails or messages attempt to trick users into revealing their passwords. These emails may appear to be from legitimate sources like banks, credit card companies, or even colleagues.
- **Brute-Force Attacks:** Automated tools systematically try different password combinations until they guess the correct one. Strong passwords with a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are more resistant to brute-force attacks.
- **Dictionary Attacks:** These attacks try common words and phrases found in dictionaries or leaked password databases to guess passwords. Using complex, unique passwords helps mitigate this risk.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers trick users into revealing their passwords through manipulation or deception. This could involve posing as a technical support representative or exploiting a user's sense of urgency or fear.
- **Keyloggers:** These malicious programs record all keystrokes typed on a computer, including passwords. Anti-virus software and good security hygiene (not entering passwords on untrusted devices) can help prevent keyloggers.

## 2.5. The Organizations Facing Cybercrime and Nuisances

Cybercrime has become a widespread threat, which target:

- **Businesses:** From small shops to global corporations, all are vulnerable. Data breaches, ransomware, and financial scams are major threats.
- **Government Agencies:** Sensitive information and critical infrastructure make them prime targets for espionage and disruption.
- **Critical Infrastructure Providers:** Power grids, water systems, and communication networks are at risk from cyberattacks causing widespread chaos.
- **Educational Institutions:** Student records, research data, and online learning platforms can be targeted.
- **Individuals:** Everyone is a potential victim of phishing scams, identity theft, and financial fraud.

### 2.5.1. Dark figure of cybercrime

The true extent of cybercrime is difficult to measure due to the secret nature of these activities.
Many cyberattacks go unreported, either because victims are unaware of the attack or are reluctant to report it due to fear of reputational damage or legal repercussions.
This unreported crime is known as the dark figure of cybercrime. some reasons why cyberattacks go unreported:

- **Lack of awareness:** Some victims might not even realize they have been attacked, especially if the attack was sophisticated or targeted a specific part of the system.
- **Fear of damage:** Businesses may be hesitant to report an attack if they fear it will damage their reputation or lead to a loss of customer trust.
- **Legal concerns:** Some organizations may worry that reporting an attack could open them up to legal liability, especially if sensitive data was breached.
- **Technical challenges:** Investigating a cyberattack can be complex and expensive, and some organizations may not have the resources to do so effectively.

The lack of accurate data on cybercrime makes it difficult to assess the true impact of these attacks and develop effective prevention strategies.

### 2.5.2. Safety culture

A safety culture is an organizational environment that prioritizes security and risk mitigation. In the context of cybersecurity, a safety culture emphasizes the importance of protecting information assets and systems from cyberattacks. some characteristics of a strong safety culture:

- **Security awareness:** Employees are educated about cyber threats and best practices for protecting themselves and the organization's data.
- **Incident reporting:** Employees are encouraged to report suspicious activity or potential security incidents without fear of reprisal.
- **Shared responsibility:** Everyone in the organization, from senior management to IT staff to regular employees, has a role to play in cybersecurity.
- **Continuous improvement:** The organization regularly evaluates its security posture and implements improvements to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

## 2.6. Control of IT risk of criminal origin

Since cybercrime is constantly evolving, it's crucial to have a comprehensive approach to managing IT risks of criminal origin. This involves a combination of preventive, detective, and corrective measures.

- **Preventive measures:** These controls aim to stop cyberattacks from happening in the first place. Examples include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, data encryption, and employee security awareness training.
- **Detective measures:** These controls help identify cyberattacks that have already occurred. Examples include log monitoring, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and vulnerability scanning.
- **Corrective measures:** These controls aim to minimize the damage from a cyberattack and prevent similar attacks from happening in the future. Examples include incident response plans, data recovery procedures, and patching vulnerabilities.

### 2.6.1. Limitations of security solutions

No security solution is foolproof, and cybercriminals are constantly developing new techniques to bypass security controls. some limitations of security solutions to consider:

- **Complexity:** Security solutions can be complex to implement and maintain, requiring ongoing investment in technology and expertise.
- **Cost:** Effective security solutions can be expensive, especially for smaller organizations.
- **Evolving threats:** Cybercriminals are constantly developing new attack methods, so security solutions need to be constantly updated to keep pace.
- **Human error:** Even with the best security controls in place, human error can still lead to security breaches. Social engineering attacks, for example, can exploit human vulnerabilities to bypass technical security measures.

Despite these limitations, security solutions play a vital role in protecting organizations from cyberattacks. By implementing a layered security approach that combines preventive, detective, and corrective measures, organizations can significantly reduce their IT risk.
